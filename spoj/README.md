## Hall of Fame

Some solutions to problems which I considered relevant and will later review before competition.
Tried to group them by theme but some either have none or use many to reach a solution.

## Binary Search

* [**AGGRCOW**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AGGRCOW/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/aggrcow.cpp))  
Place cows in different barn stalls maximizing the minimum distance between each one


## Dynamic Programming

* [**PARTY**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/PARTY/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/party.cpp))  
Find the set of parties to attend maxmizing fun rate and minimizing costs. 0/1 knapsack approach.


## Binary Search + Dynamic Programming

* [**AMR11A**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/AMR11A/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/amr11a.cpp))  
Find the minimum initial strength for Harry Potter to transverse a magical grid of enemies and allies. Solution identical to SHROOMS.

* [**SHROOMS**](https://www.spoj.com/problems/SHROOMS/) ([MySolution](https://github.com/joao-conde/competitive-programming/blob/master/spoj/shrooms.cpp))  
Find the minimum initial shrooms for a guy to transverse a forest of wild boars and shrooms. Solution identical to AMR11A.


## Graphs
