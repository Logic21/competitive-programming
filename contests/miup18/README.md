# MIUP 2018 (Maratona Inter-Universitária de Programação)

This folder contains the solutions to the MIUP 2018 edition.
Although our team of 3 participated, we did not manage to solve any problem. 
We believe it to be due to the lack of training and poor management of the single computer provided in this competition aswell as a poor choice of order in the problems to solve.

Still, it was an amazing experience and definitively looking to repeat in the future.
