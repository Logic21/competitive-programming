# Competitive Programming Contests

Training exercises for programming competitions


## About

The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make super good 'quality' code I only intend to come up with a program to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as possible (and to have fun of course). Still I try to keep it clean.


## Repository Structure

The repository contains:

1. A folder with solutions for each online judge
2. A book about competitive programming (freely distributed by the author)
3. A template cpp file for competitive programming solutions
