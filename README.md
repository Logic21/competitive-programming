## Solutions

The solutions found and implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make super 'quality' code I only intend to come up with a program to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as possible (and to have fun of course). For this reason some of the code might be what is commonly referred to as "spaghetti code". Still I try to keep it as clean as possible thus founding a middle term between solving the problem speed and code organization.
