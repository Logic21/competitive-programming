# Competitive Programming Contests

Training exercises for programming competitions from online judging websites

## About

The solutions implemented are my own and they are often a product of quick thinking and coding. I do not intend to make super good 'quality' code I only intend to come up with a program to solve the problem as quickly and as efficiently as possible (and to have fun of course). Still I try to keep it clean.

Also, the programming style for a competitive environment changes a bit. 

Some code was provided by the professors at FEUP, namely the data structures used in graph algorithms and these aswell.


## Repository Structure

The repository contains:

1. A folder with solutions for each online judge
2. Books about competitive programming (freely distributed by the authors) found in 'docs'
3. A template cpp file for competitive programming solutions found in 'docs'
